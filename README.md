Predicting Orthopedic Rehabilitation Success Amongst Athletes : Machine Learning Approach
Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-driven predictive model to assess the likelihood of successful orthopedic rehabilitation in athletes at a professional level. <br>
The system aims analyze various factors influencing rehabilitation outcomes, with a focus on injury severity, treatment plans, physiological data, and athlete-specific attributes. <br>

Objectives
+ Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting rehabilitation success based on clinical, biomechanical, and performance-related data.
+ Identify key factors that influence recovery outcomes in athletes.
+ Provide a decision-support system for sports medicine professionals to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs.
+ Enhance injury management by integrating predictive analytics into digital health applications.

Key Features
+ Data Collection & Processing: Integration of patient medical history, rehabilitation progress reports, wearable sensor data, and performance metrics.
+ Machine Learning Model: Development and validation of predictive algorithms using supervised learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, or ensemble methods).
+ Feature Engineering: Identification of the most relevant factors affecting rehabilitation outcomes, such as muscle strength, range of motion, and adherence to rehabilitation protocols.
+ Dashboard & Visualization: An interactive interface for clinicians to view predictions, trends, and insights from the model.
+ Continuous Learning: Implementation of a feedback loop where new patient data refines and enhances the AI model over time.

Technologies & Tools
+ Programming Languages: Java, PERL
+ Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
+ Machine Learning: TensorFlow
+ Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
+ Deployment: Flask/FastAPI for API development, Cloud
